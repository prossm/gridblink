# gridblink

An oddly satisfying memory game.

## Overview

gridblink is an interactive memory game that challenges players to replicate sequences of musical tones. The computer plays a sequence of circles, each producing a distinct musical note, and players must tap the circles in the same order. With each successful round, the sequence grows longer and more challenging.

**Key Features:**

- Configurable timezone and daily reset time for your community
- Daily rotating musical scales synchronized with leaderboard resets
- Adjustable game speed to match your skill level
- Daily leaderboards to compete against your community
- Automatic daily posts with customizable timing
- Seamless desktop and mobile experience

## For Moderators: Installation

1. Navigate to your subreddit's mod tools
2. Go to the Apps section
3. Search for "gridblink" in the app directory
4. Click "Install" to add gridblink to your community

Upon installation, a game post will be created automatically. By default, gridblink creates a new game post every day at 5am in your configured timezone, synchronized with the daily leaderboard reset.

### Configuring Settings

After installation, you can customize gridblink for your community by accessing the app settings:

**Timezone**: Select your community's timezone (defaults to US Eastern). This affects when the daily leaderboard resets and when musical scales rotate.

**Daily Reset Time**: Choose what hour of day (in your timezone) the leaderboard resets and musical scales change (defaults to 5:00 AM).

**Automatic Daily Posts**: Enable or disable automatic post creation (defaults to enabled). When enabled, gridblink automatically creates a new game post each day.

**Automatic Post Time**: Choose what time (in your timezone) to automatically create new posts each day (defaults to 5:00 AM, matching the reset time).

### Manual Post Creation

At any time, moderators can create a new gridblink post manually by:

1. Clicking the three-dot menu in the top-right of your subreddit
2. Selecting "Create a new post"
3. Choosing "gridblink" from the options

## How to Play

1. Click or tap "Start Playing" to begin
2. Watch as the computer lights up circles in sequence, each playing a unique musical tone
3. Repeat the pattern by tapping the circles in the same order
4. Each successful round adds one more circle to the sequence
5. One incorrect tap ends the game and displays your score on the leaderboard

**Tips for Success:**

- Listen to the musical tones - each circle has a distinct note
- Start with slower speeds while learning the game
- Use both visual and audio memory to remember patterns
- Check back daily for fresh musical scales

## Features

**Adjustable Speed:** Control the game pace with speed settings ranging from slow (ideal for beginners) to fast (for experienced players seeking a challenge).

**Daily Leaderboards:** Compete against other members of your subreddit. Leaderboards reset daily at the configured time in your community's timezone, giving everyone a fresh chance to claim the top spot.

**Rotating Musical Scales:** The nine circles use different pentatonic scale notes each day, creating a unique audio experience. Scales rotate at the same time as the leaderboard reset, keeping gameplay fresh.

**Timezone Configuration:** Moderators can set the game's timezone and daily reset time to match their community's preferences, ensuring optimal engagement times.
